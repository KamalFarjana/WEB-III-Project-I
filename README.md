## General information
In this project, we have created book exchange website to provide a service to the people of Thunder Bay. The aim of the application is to enhance the lifestyle of the local community.

### Mission Statement
Exchanging books save you time, money, shelf space, and environment.

### About Book Xchange
BookXchange is a community for exchanging used books for free.
It's a great crime to have a book disappear, out of print, for none to read. We keep books in circulation and find new readers for them. 
You give your books you no longer need in exchange for book you really want. 
We strive to make a platform where locals exchange books and try to contribute to the community.
